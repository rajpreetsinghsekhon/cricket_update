                Cricket was introduced to India by British sailors in the early 18th century. The first recorded match took place in 1721 near Kutch, Gujarat. By the late 1700s, cricket had spread among British colonists in Calcutta, Bombay, and Madras. The first Indian cricket club, the Oriental Cricket Club, was established by the Parsis in Bombay in 1848. Soon after, other communities like Hindus and Muslims began forming their own clubs. Matches between communities led to the famous Quadrangular and Pentangular tournaments. In 1911, the first all-Indian team toured England, marking a significant step in Indian cricket history. India was granted Test status in 1932 and played its first Test match at Lord’s against England. Though victories were rare in the early years, cricket’s popularity continued to rise. After independence in 1947, India began building its national team. India won its first Test series in 1952 against England. The 1970s saw stars like Sunil Gavaskar and Kapil Dev emerge. In 1983, India shocked the world by winning the Cricket World Cup under Kapil Dev’s captaincy. Cricket became a national obsession. The 1990s brought a new wave of legends, including Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, and Sourav Ganguly. The team grew stronger and more competitive globally. In 2007, India won the first T20 World Cup under MS Dhoni. The Indian Premier League (IPL) started in 2008, transforming cricket with a blend of entertainment and sport. In 2011, India won the ODI World Cup at home, once again under Dhoni’s leadership. Virat Kohli rose as a modern icon in the 2010s. India became a top-ranked team in all formats of the game. Indian women’s cricket also gained attention with strong World Cup performances. India hosted multiple ICC tournaments, showcasing its cricketing infrastructure. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) became one of the most powerful bodies in world cricket. Today, cricket in India is more than just a sport—it is a shared passion and cultural force that unites millions.</b></h3>
