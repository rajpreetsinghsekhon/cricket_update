                Cricket in Ireland has a long but often overlooked history, dating back to the 18th century when it was introduced by British soldiers and settlers. The first recorded cricket match in Ireland was played in 1792 in Dublin. During the 19th century, the sport grew steadily, with clubs forming across the country, but political tensions and the rise of Gaelic games limited its development. Despite this, cricket retained a loyal following, especially in Northern Ireland and among certain schools and communities. Ireland played its first international match in 1855 against the Gentlemen of England. Throughout the 20th century, Ireland competed mostly against other associate nations and county sides, as it was not a Test-playing nation. The Irish Cricket Union (now Cricket Ireland) was established in 1923 to govern the sport. In the 1990s and early 2000s, Irish cricket saw steady improvement in performance and infrastructure. The major breakthrough came in the 2007 ICC Cricket World Cup, where Ireland stunned the cricketing world by defeating Pakistan and tying with Zimbabwe, eventually reaching the Super Eight stage. This success increased interest and investment in the sport. Ireland followed up with strong performances in the 2011 and 2015 World Cups, including a memorable win over England in 2011, thanks to Kevin O’Brien’s record-breaking century. These achievements paved the way for Ireland to gain Test status in 2017, becoming the 11th full member of the ICC. Ireland played its inaugural Test match against Pakistan in May 2018 in Dublin. Although they lost, their performance was widely praised. Players like Kevin O’Brien, William Porterfield, Paul Stirling, Ed Joyce, and Boyd Rankin became key figures in Irish cricket’s rise. The domestic structure was strengthened with the introduction of professional contracts and inter-provincial competitions. Cricket Ireland also focused on grassroots development, aiming to make the game more accessible across the island. Despite challenges such as weather, funding, and competition from other sports, cricket in Ireland continues to grow. Today, Ireland competes in all three formats and regularly challenges established teams. The journey of Irish cricket is seen as one of perseverance, ambition, and steady progress, earning respect on the global stage.</b></h3>
