                Cricket in Afghanistan has one of the most remarkable and inspiring histories in world sport. The game was introduced by Afghan refugees living in Pakistan during the 1980s and 1990s, as they fled war and conflict at home. Many young Afghans learned the game in refugee camps, particularly in regions like Peshawar, where cricket was already popular. When refugees returned home in the early 2000s, they brought cricket with them, sparking its growth across the country. The Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB) was founded in 1995, and the national team played its first international match in 2001. Despite limited resources and facilities, the team rose rapidly through the ranks of world cricket. In 2008, Afghanistan gained one-day international (ODI) status by performing well in the World Cricket League. A major milestone came in 2010 when they qualified for their first ICC World Twenty20. Their fearless style of play won global admiration. Players like Mohammad Nabi, Rashid Khan, and Asghar Afghan became symbols of national pride. In 2015, Afghanistan played in their first ICC Cricket World Cup, winning their first match against Scotland. Their consistent progress earned them Test status in 2017, making them the 12th full member of the ICC. They played their inaugural Test against India in 2018. Domestically, cricket became hugely popular, often uniting a divided country. The rise of the Shpageeza Cricket League helped discover and promote new talent. Afghanistan's spinners, especially Rashid Khan and Mujeeb Ur Rahman, gained fame in global T20 leagues. The team qualified directly for the 2019 World Cup and impressed again at the 2023 World Cup with wins over England, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. Despite political upheavals, the national team has continued to perform and inspire. Cricket has become a source of hope and unity for millions of Afghans. The sport's development continues, with efforts to expand infrastructure and opportunities for young players. Afghanistan's cricket journey reflects resilience, passion, and the power of sport to overcome adversity.</b></h3>
